GITHUB:

stages in GitHub
1. working area -> untracked files(not tracked in GitHub) 
2. Staging -> tracked files 
   once we execute git add command the untracked files will be tracked by the GitHub to commit
   git add . => to add all files
   git add "filename" => to add specific file
3. Local repository -> Now we can commit the files with commit message so that the files can be   
   stored or copied in out local(git commit -m "commit message")
4. Remote repository -> This is the stage where we push the code into GitHub to specific branch
   It'll push the code to central repository
   command: git push origin 

Git Commands:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master
 
git reset -> to move the repository back to the previous commit
git revert commit id -> to remove the changes made by the previous commit

Difference between Git reset and Git revert:
In git reset the it removes all the previous commits that are done before the git reset commit
where as in git revert it reverts the changes done in that particular commit and creates a new commit with reversed changes.

Commands:
changes revert
git push origin master
git reset commit id --hard
 
git log -> to view the logs
git log -2 -> to view the recents 2 logs
git show commit id -> shows the modified file details along with the changes 
git show --pretty="" --name-only commit id -> shows only the modified file name
